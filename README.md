# Hello Everyone,

# My name is Zachary Ragone. I'm an aspiring data scientist who has worked diligently to grow my skills over the last 2 years. I am also enrolled at the University of St. Thomas where I am earning a masterâ€™s degree in data science in May 2025. This git hub profile will showcase some projects that I have completed in my time at the University of St. Thomas.

# I currently work at U.S. Bank as an Customer Experience Data Analyst. I'm focused on finding insights on how we can improve our customer experience using data mining techniques, automated queries, automated Power BI dashboards, SQL, SAS, and many other methods. I also have a lot of experience working with stakeholders to understand the core business questions so I can provide the most impactful results.
